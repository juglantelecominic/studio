# Fixing Airwallex Authentication Issues

This guide explains how to resolve the authentication issues with the Airwallex payment integration.

## Implemented Fixes

The following fixes have been implemented to address the 500 authentication errors:

1. **Enhanced Authentication Flow**
   - Added a more reliable fetch-based authentication method
   - Implemented proper error handling for authentication failures
   - Added retry logic for more resilient token acquisition

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - Added detailed error logging throughout the payment process
   - Created a test endpoint (`/api/payment/test-auth`) to verify authentication separately
   - Added fallback to mock payment system when authentication fails

3. **Added Mock Payment System**
   - Implemented a mock payment endpoint for development use
   - Added automatic fallback to mock payments when real payment fails
   - Enhanced mock payment responses to simulate real payment flows

## How to Test Authentication

1. **Test the Authentication Directly**
   ```
   GET /api/payment/test-auth
   ```
   This endpoint will attempt to authenticate with Airwallex and return the result.

2. **Debug Authentication Issues**
   - Check server logs for detailed error messages
   - Look for "Response data" and "Response status" in the logs
   - Verify that your API credentials are correct in `.env.local`

3. **Common Authentication Issues**
   - Incorrect API credentials
   - Network connectivity problems
   - Rate limiting by Airwallex
   - Account permissions issues

## Next Steps for Full Resolution

If you continue to experience authentication issues:

1. **Contact Airwallex Support**
   - Share the specific error messages from the logs
   - Ask them to check your account configuration
   - Verify that your API credentials have the correct permissions

2. **Check Network Configuration**
   - Ensure your server can make outbound HTTPS requests
   - Check if there are any firewalls or proxies blocking the requests
   - Test API connectivity from different networks

3. **Verify Account Status**
   - Make sure your Airwallex account is active and in good standing
   - Check if there are any account limitations or restrictions
   - Ensure your account is properly configured for API access

## Development Without Authentication

While resolving authentication issues, you can continue development using:

1. **Mock Payment Endpoint**
   ```
   POST /api/payment/mock-payment
   ```
   This endpoint simulates payment intent creation without requiring authentication.

2. **Automatic Fallback**
   The payment form will automatically fall back to mock payments if authentication fails.

3. **Mock Payment Status**
   ```
   GET /api/payment/status/{id}
   ```
   This endpoint will return mock status for any payment intent ID starting with "int_demo_" or "pi_mock_".

## Debugging Tools

The following tools have been added to help diagnose issues:

1. **Authentication Test Endpoint** - `/api/payment/test-auth`
2. **Mock Payment Endpoint** - `/api/payment/mock-payment`
3. **Enhanced Error Logging** - Check server logs for detailed error information
4. **Visual Error Display** - Errors are now displayed clearly in the UI
