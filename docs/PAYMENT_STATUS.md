# Payment Integration Status

## Current Status

As of July 22, 2025, the payment integration has been updated to prioritize the mock payment system due to authentication issues with the Airwallex API. The system now automatically uses the mock payment system, which simulates the payment flow without requiring actual Airwallex API calls.

## Key Components

1. **Payment Form (`src/components/sections/payment-form.tsx`)**
   - Now configured to use the mock payment system by default
   - Includes a polling mechanism to check payment status
   - Displays real-time payment status updates to users

2. **Mock Payment System**
   - Mock payment creation endpoint: `/api/payment/mock-payment`
   - Mock payment status endpoint: `/api/payment/mock-status/[id]`
   - Simulates a realistic payment flow with status transitions

3. **Authentication System**
   - Multiple authentication methods implemented in `src/lib/airwallex.ts`
   - Authentication test endpoint: `/api/payment/test-auth`
   - Currently experiencing 401/403 errors with all authentication methods

## Switching to Real Payments

To switch back to real payments using Airwallex:

1. Open `src/components/sections/payment-form.tsx`
2. Locate line 177: `const useMockPayment = true;`
3. Change to `const useMockPayment = false;`

This will make the system attempt to authenticate with Airwallex first, and only fall back to mock payments if authentication fails.

## Next Steps

1. **Contact Airwallex Support**
   - Share the authentication errors (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden)
   - Confirm API credentials are correctly set up on their side
   - Verify account permissions for payment intents

2. **Review Environment Configuration**
   - Double-check `.env.local` file for correct API credentials
   - Verify API endpoint URLs are correct (demo vs. production)

3. **Test with Different Authentication Methods**
   - Current implementation tries multiple authentication approaches
   - None currently succeeding with status 401/403 errors
